The origin of the tiles can be found [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/neonworld-2020-42472876).  

The file "tiles.iff" contains a slightly modified version. In some cases color zero was used for non-transparent pixels. Because I use sprites behind the playfield I fixed these pixels.  
Another thing that I fixed: I removed the comma and aligned the letters X, Y and Z so that every letter fits in a 8x8 pixel box.

Hello Amigans :)  

All the source files are created for anyone in the Amiga community who could like to create their own game.  The idea was to supply all graphics assets that a coder could play around with and build a game.  I’d love to see people see what they can do with the game engines we have today such as RedPill, Scorpion, Amos, Blitzbasic or other.  

ALL source files are OCS compatible.   

Usage:  To use any or all of these graphics for creating games on the AMIGA platform.
If you do decide to use any graphics please credit me with the following.
