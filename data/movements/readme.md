LibreOffice Calc is used to define movements of objects.  
A sheet is created that contains x and y positions as absolute values. Since the coordinate system as used by Calc for X/Y-graphs is bottom-up for the Y value this must be transformed to the bottom-down Y value inside the game.  
The absolute coordinates are converted to X- and Y-add-values as 16 bit signed words.
